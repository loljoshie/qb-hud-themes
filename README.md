A whole bunch of community made themes for QBCore's newest qb-hud menu and YOU can also contribute your design as well! Just make sure when you send in a Pull Request; everything is contained in the style.css that should be the ONLY file being added and provide a preview picture inside the readme just like all the other themes! ❤️
